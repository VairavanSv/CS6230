Template code for CS6230 Assignments

Students should check out this repository and add a folder under students named
after their uid. All code should be within this folder.

You can use the 'build.py' script to compile and test your code. 

The options are,

```bash
$ build.py sample  p1 # will compile 'p1' in the directory 'sample' under students/ 
$ build.py test       # will run tests
$ build.py archive    # will generate the zip file for submission
```
